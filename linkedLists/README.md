# Linked Lists

---

**A linked list is a datastructure in which each node points to another node.**

**A linked list is a dynamic data structure that can allocate and deallocate
memory at runtime.**

---

## Types of Linked Lists

**Single Linked Lists**

A node in a singly linked list has the following properties: data and next. data
is the value for the linked list node.

**Doubly Linked Lists**

A doubly linked list can be thought of as a bidirectional singly linked list.
Each node in the doubly linked list has both a next pointer and a prev pointer.

**Circularly Linked Lists**

A circularly linked list is similar to a singly linked list and has the same
type of nodes. The only difference is that a circularly linked list, when
created, has its head nodeâ€™s next property point back to itself.
